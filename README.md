--Overview--

This notebook utilizes the mushroom dataset from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms. The goal of this notebook is to display how a KNN Classifer can impute missing values and the importance of dimensionality reduction using PCA. Two simple models (Random Forest Classifier, Logisitc Regression) were trained and used to make predictions on whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on several attributes. The models were trained with and without PCA dimensionality reduction to compare. The performance measures: accuracy, precision, recall, training time were used to compare the effect of PCA on the models.

Skills: KNN, PCA, Random Forest Classifier, Logisitc Regression
